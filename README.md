# SegNet Image Segmentation

This repository contains a complete implementation of a SegNet model for image segmentation tasks. SegNet is a deep learning architecture specifically designed for semantic segmentation, capable of classifying each pixel in an image.


## Features

- Implementation of the SegNet architecture.
- Custom dataset loader for easy integration of your image data.
- Loss functions including Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) and Dice Loss for improved training.
- Training and validation scripts with logging.
- Preprocessing steps for image and mask data.
